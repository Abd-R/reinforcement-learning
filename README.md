# Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of two reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN). The implementations are done from scratch using Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym, and Keras libraries.

- **Q-Learning**: Implemented in `q-rl.ipynb`
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Implemented in `dqn.ipynb`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- OpenAI Gym
- Keras

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks `q-rl.ipynb` and `dqn.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Implemented Features
- Reinforcement learning algorithms:
  - Q-Learning for discrete action spaces
  - Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete action spaces with deep neural networks
- Usage of OpenAI Gym environments for training and testing RL models
- Training and evaluation of RL models using custom environments and Gym environments
- Saving and loading trained models
- Learning curves and performance analysis

## Learned Concepts
- Basics of reinforcement learning, Q-Learning, and DQN algorithms
- Implementation of Q-Learning with Q-Tables and epsilon-greedy policy
- Integration of deep neural networks with Q-Learning for handling complex state-action spaces in DQN
- Experience replay and target network concepts in DQN for stability and improved learning
